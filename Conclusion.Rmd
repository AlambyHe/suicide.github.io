# Conclusion

According to the WHO suicide data from 1979 to 2016, South Korea had the highest suicide growth rate, while Northern European countries such as Estonia and Latvija's suicide rate decresed the most. Overall, suicide rate decreased as time went by, and 2/3 countries had a decreasing trend.

GDP(Gross Domestic Product) and HDI(Human Development Index) are commenly believed to have association with suicide rate. We found that in Europe, suicide rate decreased as GDP per capita and HDI increased; while in America, suicide rate increased as GDP per capita and HDI increased.

We also discovered other correlations in continent level. In Asia, suicide rate had positive correlations with degree of satisfaction with family and freedom; In Europe, suicide rate had negative correlations with gdp per capita and happiness score; In America, suicide rate had positive correlations with gdp per capita, happiness score, degree of satisfaction with family and life expectancy.

# Suicide Prevention

suicides are preventable and effective interventions exist. First and foremost, early identification and treatment of depression and alcohol use disorders are key for the prevention of suicide at individual level, as well as follow-up contact with those who have attempted suicide and psychosocial support in communities. Equally important are effective interventions at population level aiming to reduce access to the means of suicide, to adopt responsible reporting of suicide by the media, and to introduce alcohol policies to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. From the health systems perspective, it is imperative for health-care services to incorporate suicide prevention as a core component.
